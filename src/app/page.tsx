        This is my personal site. Yes, it's empty,😆 BUT it's a work in
        progress. <br /> U know what makes it different from my other portfolio
        sites? <br /> It's not empty. <br />
        It's out there. <br />
        And it is Goddamn resposive 😎
        <br />
        And that's the point.

        NB: It will be different next time you visit. Promise. Await. But not
        All 😁
